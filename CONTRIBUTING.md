# Contributing to GPT Code Review

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)

1. **Create an issue:** If you've found a bug or have a feature request, start by creating a new issue in the GitHub Issue Tracker. This helps us to keep track of what is being worked on and who is working on it.

2. **Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`:** If you're ready to start working on an issue, fork the repo and create a new branch for your work. Your branch name should be descriptive of the work you're doing.

3. **Make sure your code lints:** We use PEP8 and other standards for Python. Ensure your code follows these standards to keep everything tidy and consistent.

4. **Issue that pull request:** When your work is ready and passing all tests, you can issue a pull request. Be sure to provide a clear title and description of your pull request so we know what we're looking at.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/mgennings/GPT-code-review/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/mgennings/GPT-code-review/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

We use [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for style guidelines.
